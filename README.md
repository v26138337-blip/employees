Each entry displays key details such as name, designation, department, contact information, and profile photo. The built-in search and filter functionality allows users to quickly find employees by name, role, department, or other criteria, making it simple to connect with the right person.

This feature enhances internal communication, promotes collaboration, and ensures that employee information is easily accessible across all departments.
